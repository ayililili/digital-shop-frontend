# üõçÔ∏è Digital Product Shop (Frontend)

This project is a **prototype digital product shop** built with **React**,
**Vite**, and **Firebase**. It demonstrates Google login using Firebase
Authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file and fill in your Firebase credentials

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env with your values
   ```

3. Start the dev server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Routing


This project uses **React Router DOM** for navigation. The routes are
configured in `src/App.tsx`, and the corresponding page components live in
`src/pages`. Use the navigation links at the top of the app to switch between
the Home, Login and Product pages.

## Error Handling

Rendering errors are caught by an `ErrorBoundary` component which displays a
fallback message instead of breaking the entire app. Firebase initialization in
`src/firebase.ts` also validates that all required environment variables are
present and throws a descriptive error when any are missing.
